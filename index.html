                <p>
                    My name is Amya N. Moore, and I am a student at Agnes Scott College and Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia,
                    where I am pursuing a dual degree in Visual Arts and Computer Science.

                    I have always been interested in web design since my freshman year of college. 
                    
                    In my art, as well as my academic and personal work, my passion for both art and technology has always been an inspiration.
                    
                    I always push myself to master new skills in both disciplines as a self-starter and self-learner. 
                    
                    I aim to utilise my degree and expertise in both art and computer programming to make interactions with technology more entertaining, enjoyable, and accessible for everyone. 
                    
                    Apart from those interests, I am always eager to improve my Korean language abilities and enhance my understanding of the culture.
                    
                    In the future, I intend to pursue a master's degree in web design before looking for a job in the industry.

                        networking, exposure to senior women in computing, and career preparation. 
                        
                        Held at GeorgiaTech, participants are chosen from a broad group of undergraduate women from institutes around the metro Atlanta area. 
                        
                        The programme is divided into segments that address issues that affect all undergraduates, such as considering graduate school, 
                        as well as those that are especially likely to affect female students. 
                        
                        Women academics and researchers in computer science and engineering, as well as industry representatives, are welcome to speak. 
                        
                        Other scheduled events include resume/cv advice and a hack-a-thon for social benefit. 
                        
                        The workshop is made possible by a generous donation from Google.
